# Pizza_Sales_Project
Here's a Pizza sales project of 1 year of sales of pizzas of different categories
I have cleaned and analyzed the data of the sales of different pizzas bought daily in the year 2015, and monthly and weekly trends of the sales of pizzas
KPI :
1. Total revenue in that year
2. Average order value (in dollars)
3. Total Pizza sold in that year
4. Total orders being done
5. average pizzas bought per order

I have also analyzed the Top 5 best and top 5 worst pizzas based on
1. Total revenue
2. Total Pizza's Sold
3. Total orders
